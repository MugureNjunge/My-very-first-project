  <p>Hellow!Glad to have you here, Let's learn about one another, shall we?</p>
  <h2>I'll go first!</h2>
  <div class="intro1">
    <p>My name is Maureen as the title above boldy states, but you can call me Mugure. I was born on a cold morning,
      a few years back, the third born in a family of four.I had a typical childhood, nothing grand.I joined school at
      at 3, went to primary then Highschool and eventually to University.Growing up, I was sure I would become a
      musician
      but life had other plans.Ooh, the good old days when my friends and I would sing and play our guitars without a
      care in the world!</p>

  <div class="intro2">

    <p>Ooops, got sidetracked there. Now where was I? Ooh yes.Graduated from University and landed my first job. From a
      Field Officer to a Bank Operations Assistant, my first two years were okay but nothing too
      interesting. It was not until I joined a software development company that I started to experience life from
      a different angle.I can say for a fact,that is where the dream of becoming a sofware developer was
      first planted.A whole year later and here I am, a newbie about to embark on this rollercoaster! No no no!. Let me
      call it a journey instead.</p>

  <h3>So why Programming?</h3>
  <p>There I was, in a software development company , yearning to understand "the backend", as my colleagues called
    it. And so I made the decision to learn more about it. What better place to learn programming that at
    Moringa?And so here
    I am.The newest member of the Moringa family, ready to take over the world. Don't laugh! I am serious, I will take
    over!</p>
