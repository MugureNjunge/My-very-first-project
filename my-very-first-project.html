  <h1>Njung'e Maureen</h2>
    <p>Hellow!Glad to have you here, Let's learn about one another, won't we?</p>
    <h2>I'll go first!</h2>
    <p>My name is Maureen as the title above boldy states, but you can call me Mugure. I was born on a cold morning,
      a few years back, the third born in a family of four.I had a typical childhood, nothing grand.I joined school at
      at
      3, went to primary then Highschool and eventually to University.Growing up, I was sure I would become a musician
      but life had other plans.Ooh, the good old days when my friends and I would sing and play our guitars without a
      care in the world!</p>
    <p>Ooops, got sidetracked there. Now where was I? Ooh yes.Graduated from University and landed my first job. From a
      Field Officer to a Bank Operations Assistant, my first two year were okay but nothing too
      interesting. It was not until I joined a software development company that I started to experience life from
      a different angle.I can say for a fact,that is where the dream of becoming a sofware developer was
      first planted.A whole year later and here I am, a newbie about to embark on this rollercoater! No no no!. Let me
      call it a journey instead.</p>
    <h3>So why Programming?</h3>
    <p>There I was, in a software development company , yearning to understand "the backend", as my colleagues called
      it. And so I made the decision to learn more about it. What better place to learn programming that at
      Moringa?And so here
      I am.The newest member of the Moringa family, ready to take over the world. Don't laugh! I am serious, I will take
      over!</p>
    <h3>Current interests</h3>
    <p>As you can already guess, singing is at the very top of my list, but I have a few more:</p>
    <ul>
      <li>Playing the guitar</li>
      <li>Reading Novels and watching movies</li>
      <li>Playing with my niece and nephew - I am obsessed with them</li>
      <li>Taking long walks</li>
      <li>Latest addition would be coding, though I have just began</li>
    </ul>
    <p>This brings my short story to an end, but I will have more to talk about as the weeks progress, so be on the
      lookout!Adios!</p>
