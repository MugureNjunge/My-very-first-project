      <p>My name is Maureen as the title above boldy states, but you can call me Mugure.I had a typical childhood,
        nothing grand.I joined primary school then Highschool and eventually University.Growing up, I was sure I would become a
        musician but life had other plans.Ooh, the good old days when my friends and I would sing and play our guitars
        without a care in the world!</p>

    <div class="intro2">
      <p><em>Ooops!</em>I got sidetracked there. Now where was I? Ooh yes.Graduated from University and landed my first
        job. Worked in the corporate space for about two years then joined a startup in the software development
        sector.That is where the dream of becoming a sotfware developer was first planted.Here I am, about to embark on this rollercoaster! No no no!. Let's call it a journey.</p>

      <h3>So why Programming?</h3>
      <p>There I was, in a software development company , yearning to understand "the backend", as my colleagues called
        it. And so I made the decision to learn more about it. What better place to learn programming that at
